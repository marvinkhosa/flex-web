                <h1>Pizza pre-history</h1>
                The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with
                several toppings. ... The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta and successively in
                different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from
                there.

                Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.

                <h2>Why the ate pizza</h2>

                An often recounted story holds that on June 11, 1889, to honour the Queen consort of Italy, Margherita
                of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizzamaker Raffaele Esposito created the "Pizza Margherita", a pizza garnished
                with tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on the Flag of
                Italy.

                <h2>Pizza beyond Italy</h2>

                While pizza has been eaten in Italy for centuries, it was not until after World War II and when pizza
                became popular in America, that it became really popular in Italy.
